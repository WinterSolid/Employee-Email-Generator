# Overview
This project demonstrates an email application initially written in Java and converted to Kotlin using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The application manages employee email accounts by capturing user details, setting department-specific email addresses, generating random passwords, and displaying user information.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three main components:

## Model: Represents the data and business logic (Email.kt).
## View: Handles user interactions and display (EmailView.kt).
## Controller: Manages the communication between the Model and the View (EmailController.kt).

## Conversion from Java to Kotlin
The original Java project was converted to Kotlin for several reasons:

- Conciseness: Kotlin's syntax is more concise, reducing boilerplate code.
- Null Safety: Kotlin has built-in null safety features, reducing the risk of null pointer exceptions.
- Interoperability: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, allowing seamless integration with existing Java codebases.
- Modern Features: Kotlin offers modern programming features such as extension functions, higher-order functions, and coroutines for asynchronous programming.
